## Learn Ruby: Hands-on Path

Welcome! This repo gives you a practical, test-driven path to learn Ruby. You’ll implement small exercises and run tests to get immediate feedback.

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.x installed. Check with:
```bash
ruby -v
```

### Getting Started
1. Open the repo in your editor.
2. Implement the functions in files under `exercises/`.
3. Run the matching tests to see progress.

### Run All Tests
```bash
bin/run_tests
```

### Run a Single Test File
```bash
ruby -I test test/test_basics.rb
```

### Exercises
- `exercises/01_basics.rb`: variables, numbers, strings, booleans
- `exercises/02_control_flow.rb`: conditionals, loops, arrays, hashes
- `exercises/03_methods.rb`: methods, default args, blocks, enumerable

Each file contains TODOs and unimplemented methods. Make tests pass one by one.

### Tips
- Use `puts` for quick prints while experimenting.
- Rerun tests often. Read assertion messages; they tell you what’s wrong.
- Prefer clear names and small methods.

### Roadmap
1) Basics → 2) Control Flow → 3) Methods & Blocks → 4) Build a small CLI (coming next)
